### Learning

> acquiring skill with experience accumulated from observations.
> observations-->learning-->skil


### Machine Learning

> acquiring skill with experience accumulated/computed from data.
> data-->ML-->skill


### An application of Computational Finance
    stock data-->ML-->more investment gain

## 1.1.2 什么时候可以用ML
ML: an alternative route to build complicated systems

Some use scenarios
- when human cannot program the system manually -- navigating on Mars
- when human cannot define the solution easily --- speech/visual recognition
- when needing rapid decisions that humans cannot do --- high-frequency trading
- when needing to be user-oriented in a massive scale --- consumer-targeted marketing

Key essence of ML
- exists some 'underlying pattern' to be learned --- so 'performance measure' can be improved
- but no programmable (easy) definition --- so 'ML' is needed
- somehow there is data about the pattern --- so ML has some 'inputs' to learn from
