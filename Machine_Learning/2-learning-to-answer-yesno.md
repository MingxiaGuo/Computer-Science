#  2 Learning to Answer Yes/No

> a simple and yet useful learning model(H and A)
> PLA Algorithm takes linear separable D and perceptrons H to get hypothesis g

* Perceptron Hypothesis Set

  * hyperplanes/linear classifiers in $$R^d$$

* perceptron Learning Algorithm(PLA)

  * correct mistakes and improve iteratively

* Guarantee of PLA

  * no mistake eventually if linear separable

* Non-Separable Data
  * hold somewhat 'best' weights in pocket
