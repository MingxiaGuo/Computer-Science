Cloud-init is the industry standard multi-distribution method for cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud infrastructure, and bare-metal installations.

Cloud-init will identify the cloud it is running on during boot, read any provided metadata from the cloud and initialize the system accordingly.

On instance boot, cloud-init will identify the cloud it is running on, read any provided metadata from the cloud, and initialize the system accordingly. This may involve setting up the network and storage devices, configuring SSH access keys, and setting up many other aspects of a system. Later, cloud-init will parse and process any optional user or vendor data that was passed to the instance.

Cloud-init is the defacto multi-distribution package that handles **early initialization** of a cloud-init enabled virtual instance.

All major Linux distributions support cloud-init as a mechanism **for hypervisors to provide initialization data and scripts during the startup of Linux-based operating systems**.  For Windows operating systems, the supporting cloud-init package is called "cloudbase-init"

# Instance Metadata

Instance data is the collection of all configuration data that cloud-init processes to configure the instance. This configuration typically comes from any number of sources:

- cloud-provided metadata services (aka metadata)
- custom config-drive attached to the instance
- cloud-config seed files in the booted cloud image or distribution
- vendordata provided from files or cloud metadata services
- userdata provided at instance creationï¼šTypical userdata would include files, YAML, and shell scripts
