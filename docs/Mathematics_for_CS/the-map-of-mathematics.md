## Modern Mathematics
Modern Mathematics
* pure maths: the study of math for its own sake.
    * physics
    * computer science

* applied maths: when you develop mathematics to help solve some real world problem.

* another: crossover


### pure maths:
* number systems: (origin:natural numbers and arithmetic operations)
    * natural numbers
    * integers: negative numbers
    * rational numbers: fractions
    * real numbers: Pi
    * complex numbers
    * quaternion
    * octonion
    * cardinal numbers

    * some numbers have interesting properties
        * prime numbers
        * Pi
        * exponential
        * infinity
    * arithmetic operations: 

* structures: the study of structures is where you start taking numbers and putting them into equations in the form of variables.
    * equation: y=mx+c
    * algebra: the rules of how you then manipulate these equations
       * linera algebra
            * vectors: muti-dimensional numbers
            * matrices: muti-dimensional numbers
    * Number theory: studies the features of everything in the last section on numbers like the properties of prime numbers.
    * Combinatorics: properties of certain structures like tree, graphs, and other things that are made of discreet chunks that you can count
    * Gooup theory: objects that are related to each other in, well, groups.(魔方是置换群的例子)
    * Order theory: how to arrange objects following certain rules like, how someting is a larger quatity than something else.
* shapes and spaces
    * Geometry: trigonometry
    * fractal geometry
    * topology: different properties of spaces where you are allowed to continuously deform them but not tear or gule them.莫比乌斯环
    * Measure theory： a way to assign values to spaces or sets tying together numbers and spaces
    * differential geometry: looks the properties of shapes on curved surfaces
* changes
    * calculus: area spanned out by functions or the behaviour of gradients of functions
        * integrals
        * differentials
        * vector calcilus
    * dynamical systems
    * chaos comples
    * complex analysis: properties of functions whith complex numbers


### applied mathematics
* mathematical physics
    * theoretical physics
* mathematical chemistry
* Biomathematics
* engineering
    * building 
    * control theory: complex electrical systems: aeroplanes, power grid, 
* numerical analysis
* game theory
    * economics
    * psychology
    * biology
* Probability: the study of random events 
* Statistics: the study of large collection of random processes or the organisation and analysis if data.
    * mathematics finance
* Optimieation

* computer science
    * machine learning
        * linear algebra; optimisation; dynamical system; probability

* cryptography
    * combinatorics
    * number theory

fundations: try to work out at the properties of mathematics itself and asks what the basis of all the rules of mathematics is
    * fundamental rules
    * mathematical logic
    * set theory
    * category theory
    * godel incompleteness theorems
    * theory of computation
        * complexity theory: Pb不等于NP
