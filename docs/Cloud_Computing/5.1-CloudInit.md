# CloudInit 

https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Cloud-init is the industry standard multi-distribution method for cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud infrastructure, and bare-metal installations.

Cloud-init will identify the cloud it is running on during boot, read any provided metadata from the cloud and initialize the system accordingly.
