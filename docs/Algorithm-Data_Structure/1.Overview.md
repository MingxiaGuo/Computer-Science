数据存储、整理、分组。

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

We take about data structures as :

1. Mathematical/ logical models  ——> abstract data types (ADTs) ; ex: List

* List
  * store a given 

2. Implementation



Abstract data types (ADTs) define data and operations, but no implementation. (Includes Arrays, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph....)

* Logical view
* operations
* cost of operations
* Implementation. 



List as abstract data type



List

* store a give number of elements of a given data-type
* Write/modify element of a position
* Read element at a position



empty list has size 0

Insert remove cpunt read/modify
