## Three steps for deep learning

1. **Neural Network**: A neural network is a function composed of simple functions(neurons);

   usually we design the network structure, and let machine find parameters from data

2. **Cost Function**: Cost function evaluates how good a set of parameters is; 

   We design the cost function based on the task

3. **Optimization**: Find the best function set (e.g. gradient descent)

## Basic structures

### 1. Fully Connected Layer
